# Interactive-Drum-Kit
I developed an Interactive Drum Kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide a fun and engaging way for users to create and play music directly from their web browsers.
The project employs HTML to structure the keyboard interface, featuring a series of visually distinct keys that mimic a traditional piano layout. Each key is styled with CSS to provide a realistic look and feel, including responsive design elements that ensure the keyboard adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
JavaScript brings the keyboard to life by handling user interactions
